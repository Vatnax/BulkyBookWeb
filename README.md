### The idea behind this project
This project was supposed to introduce me into web applications creation world. It's not really mine - I made it from a tutorial. Somehow I had to learn ASP.NET so I took an online course which explained how this framework works and I've created the application. Here is the link to the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-aspnet-core-21-course/). It's a simple application that was only supposed to teach me how to do stuff in ASP.NET.

### Some tech stuff
An application is built upon ASP.NET Core (.NET 6) with C#. Despite the backend part, where I have implented ASP.NET Core Identity, MVC pattern, databases, payment system and much more, I also do have a frontend part, which consists of JS with JQuery, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and many external libraries for JS.
